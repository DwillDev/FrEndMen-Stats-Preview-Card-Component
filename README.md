## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the most important things I learned through completing this project was creating a responsive website purely through the use of CSS. A large amount of trial and error took place over the course of over a week and many hours until I was able to reach a level of responsiveness that I was proud of. In addition to that, I also learned about different elements such as object-ft and object-position and the properties that grid and flexbox share that I was not aware of and how much easier it is to start witht he mobile-first approach and work upwards.

I can't say im particularly proud of my code, as I am sure that there are many things I could have done to mitigate the amount of media queries or shrink the div container in a more user-pleasing way.


### Continued development

In future projects, I am interested in figuring out ways to use less code to get to the end product as well as becoming more comfortable with flexbox and grid so that I don't run into as many issues getting a webpage to look the way I want to on various screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This was a huge help to me because I could read similar issues that other coders were having and utilize their solutions.
- [Angela Delise](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_TjoSnaI3CTgIgmSn3rruA) - I watched several of her videos when I was stuck, the main one which helped me was her video on responsive cards using flexbox and grid.
